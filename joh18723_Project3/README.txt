Make sure all files, and the JUnit files are open in intelliJ and then run the Junit tests from
ArrayListTest.java and LinkedListTest.java

The merge method in arrayList has a bug, it won't add on elements from otherList that are greater than every 
value in list.

ArrayList fails the isSorted unit test with nullPointerException that I can't explain
ArrayList fails the merge test (because the final length is not what it should be) and the sizeAndClear test
because it comes out 1 less than it should be for a reason I can't explain.

I certify that the information contained in this README file is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed
the course policies in the 'Academic Integrity - Course Policy' section of the course syllabus.
